# Hey Eugen!

This should create a scrollable TikTok section we can try using for Footer.

Obvious TODO:
- Add inertia to drag behavior
- Bind the scrollable area to the height of the child
- Use the sentenials to update the scroll lock (so user can go to next/previous slide)

I'm thinking after the logic is set, we can put it all in the useScrollSectionLogic hook.
